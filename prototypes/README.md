# Dashboard Prototypes & Iteration

## 🎯 Purpose

This folder is for **rapid iteration and experimentation** on dashboard designs before integrating them into the production code.

## 📁 Structure

```
prototypes/
├── dashboard-layouts/     # Full dashboard layout experiments
├── components/            # Individual reusable components
└── README.md             # This file
```

## 🚀 Workflow

### 1. Design Phase (Fast Iteration)
- Create static HTML files in `dashboard-layouts/`
- Experiment with different layouts, colors, and components
- Use inline CSS or link to main stylesheet
- Open directly in browser to preview

### 2. Component Phase
- Break down your favorite layout into reusable components
- Create individual component files in `components/`
- Test each component in isolation

### 3. Integration Phase
- Once you're happy with a design, integrate it into `/dashboard/index.php`
- Add PHP logic, authentication, and database queries
- Test with real data

## 💡 Tips

- **Start simple**: Pick one layout and iterate on it
- **Mobile-first**: Test responsive behavior early
- **Copy freely**: Duplicate files to try variations
- **Version names**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `sidebar-layout.html`, `card-grid.html`)
- **Delete liberally**: Don't be afraid to delete experiments that don't work

## 🧹 Cleanup

When dashboard v2 is complete and merged:
- You can delete this entire `prototypes/` folder
- Or keep it for reference/future iterations

**Happy iterating!** 🎨
