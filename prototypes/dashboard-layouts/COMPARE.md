# Dashboard Layout Comparison

I've created **3 different layouts** for you to compare. Each has all your requirements:

✅ Wide rectangle items stretching page width  
✅ Title + Hamburger menu (edit/delete/duplicate)  
✅ "New" button at top of list  
✅ Account dropdown with Google avatar  
✅ Matching purple/indigo color scheme

## 🔍 Quick Comparison

| Feature | Layout 1 | Layout 2 | Layout 3 |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| Content Width | Limited (1400px) | Full (minus sidebar) | Full (100%) |
| Navigation | Top header only | Sidebar + header | Top header only |

## 💡 My Recommendations

### If you want **maximum simplicity**: → **Layout 3**
Clean, minimal, easy to implement. Perfect for a template where items are the main focus.

### If you want **room to grow**: → **Layout 2**
Sidebar gives you space for more features later (Analytics, Team management, etc.)

### If you want **balanced & professional**: → **Layout 1**
Centered content looks polished on all screen sizes. Safe choice.

## 🚀 How to Compare

### View them in your browser:

```bash
# Layout 1 - Centered
open prototypes/dashboard-layouts/layout-1-centered.html

# Layout 2 - Sidebar
open prototypes/dashboard-layouts/layout-2-sidebar.html

# Layout 3 - Minimal
open prototypes/dashboard-layouts/layout-3-minimal.html
```

### Test on different screen sizes:
1. Open in browser
2. Resize window to see responsive behavior
3. Try mobile view (Command+Option+I in Chrome, toggle device toolbar)

### What to look for:
- Does it feel spacious or cramped?
- Is the text readable?
- Do the items look good?
- Does the Account dropdown work well?
- Does the hamburger menu feel natural?

## ✏️ Next Steps

1. **Pick your favorite** (or tell me what to adjust)
2. **Iterate on that one** (tweak colors, spacing, etc.)
3. **Integrate into PHP** (add real data, authentication)

**Questions?** Just ask! I can:
- Adjust any layout
- Create hybrid versions
- Change colors/spacing
- Add/remove features

Let me know which one resonates with you! 🎨
