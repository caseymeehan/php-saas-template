# Dashboard Iteration Workflow

## 🎯 Current Setup

✅ You're on the `feature/dashboard-v2` branch  
✅ Your main branch is safe and untouched  
✅ Prototypes folder is ready for experimentation  

## 📋 Workflow Steps

### 1️⃣ Design & Iterate (You are here!)

```bash
# Open the starter template in your browser
open prototypes/dashboard-layouts/starter-template.html
```

**Then iterate:**
- Modify the HTML/CSS directly
- Refresh browser to see changes instantly
- Save variations with different names
- No PHP complexity during design phase

### 2️⃣ Pick Your Favorite

Once you have a design you like:
- Note which layout/components work best
- Take screenshots for reference
- List the features you want to include

### 3️⃣ Integrate into Real Dashboard

Copy your chosen design into `/dashboard/index.php`:
- Add PHP authentication
- Connect to database
- Load real user data
- Add interactivity

### 4️⃣ Test & Refine

Test the integrated dashboard:
- Login with Google OAuth
- Check all data displays correctly
- Test responsive behavior
- Fix any bugs

### 5️⃣ Merge When Ready

When you're happy with the dashboard:

```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Complete dashboard v2 with [describe features]"

# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Merge your feature branch
git merge feature/dashboard-v2

# Optionally, delete the feature branch
git branch -d feature/dashboard-v2
```

## 🔄 Switching Between Branches

**To see your main (production) site:**
```bash
git checkout main
php -S localhost:9000
```

**To continue dashboard work:**
```bash
git checkout feature/dashboard-v2
php -S localhost:9000
```

## 💡 Tips

### Fast Iteration
- Keep `starter-template.html` open in your browser
- Edit in your code editor
- Just refresh to see changes (no server needed for prototypes!)

### Try Variations
```bash
# In prototypes/dashboard-layouts/
cp starter-template.html sidebar-layout.html
cp starter-template.html card-grid-layout.html
cp starter-template.html minimal-layout.html
```

### Component Isolation
Create standalone components in `prototypes/components/`:
- `profile-card.html` - User profile widget
- `stats-widget.html` - Statistics display
- `activity-feed.html` - Recent activity list
- `chart-card.html` - Data visualization

### Need to Switch Tasks?
```bash
# Commit your current work
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: dashboard iteration"

# Switch to main for urgent fixes
git checkout main

# Come back later
git checkout feature/dashboard-v2
```

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

Consider these dashboard patterns:
1. **Sidebar Navigation** - Left/right sidebar with main content
2. **Top Bar Navigation** - Horizontal nav, content below
3. **Card Grid** - Pinterest-style masonry layout
4. **Single Column** - Mobile-first, stacked sections
5. **Split View** - Main content + sidebar with widgets

## 🧹 Cleanup Options

### Option A: Keep Prototypes (Recommended)
- Useful for future reference
- Documents your design process
- Can reuse components later

### Option B: Delete Prototypes
```bash
rm -rf prototypes/
git add .
git commit -m "Remove prototypes after integration"
```
